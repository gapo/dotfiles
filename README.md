## pqivrc

pqivrc is an image viewer. The config file allows an user to set up pqiv to open an album and then do some pre-configured actions.

The essential objective is that you quickly can create an album from a larger set of pictures in a folder .cache-album without exiting the image viewer.

### Usage

<code> $pqiv /pathToFolder </code>

Now image viewer should open. hit 1 to save into the album

1- runs the script cpyFile.sh into a folder cache-***prefix*** in this case  album
